				<h2>Game Rules</h2>
				<h3>Round 1 - Money Round</h3>
<p>The player is required to answer a series of questions within two minutes, with the aim of banking at most $500,000 from the “MONEY TREE”. </p>
<p>
If the player answers a question correctly, the money will move upwards the “Money Tree”, by one level. If the player answers the question wrong, the money is lost and the “Money Tree” starts from $0 again.
 </p>
<p>
Before a question is asked, the player is allowed to bank the money that corresponds to the level they are at on the “Money Tree”. However, the player should not be allowed to bank money if they are on level $0 on the money tree.
</p> 
<p>
If the player banks the money it stays safe, however the “Money Tree”, will start again, from $0.
</p>
<p>
Note: the maximum you can bank for this round is $500,000
</p>
<p> 
Once the timer runs out, the player will automatically go onto round 2 along with all money banked. Also, if the user banks $500,000 before the timer runs out they will automatically go onto round 2.
</p>
<p>
If the person has $0 after round 1, they automatically lose the game. 
 </p>
<h3>
Round 2 - Sudden Death Round
</h3>
</p>
<p>
If user has no money at end of Round 1, he/she does not get to play Round #2. 
</p>
<p>
Once the player qualifies for Round 2 then they will be required to answer a series of questions within 1 minute, in this Sudden death round. Once the player correctly answer all questions asked within the specified time then they will win the game and walk away with all the money that was banked. However, any question answered incorrectly will automatically cause the player to lose the game and be deemed, “The Weakest Link”
</p>
<p>
If time runs out before the number of questions is complete, YOU ARE THE WEAKEST LINK, GOODBYE!
